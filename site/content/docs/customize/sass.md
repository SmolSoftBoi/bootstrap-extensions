## Importing

### CSS

```css
// The following line can be included in your css file
import 'bootstrap-extensions/dist/css/bootstrap-extensions.min.css';
```

In case you are using Sass the simplest way is to include the Bootstrap Extensionsâ€™ source Sass files in your main Sass file. You might have to setup the bundler of your choice to compile Sass/SCSS stylesheets to CSS.

```scss
// The following line can be included in a scss file
@import "bootstrap-extensions/scss/bootstrap-extensions";
```

If you wish to customize the Bootstrap Extensions theme or any Bootstrap Extensions variables you can create a custom Sass file:

```scss
// The following block can be included in a scss file

// Make the customisations
$theme-colors: (
  "info": tomato,
  "danger": teal
);

// import Bootstrap Extensions to set changes
@import "bootstrap-extensions/scss/bootstrap-extensions";
```
